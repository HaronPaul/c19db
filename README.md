# Local Environment Setup:
    1. Clone branch 'master' into your local repo
    2. Use npm i or npm install to install dependencies

# Workflow
    1. Please do not push into master branch
    2. Create your own branch named 'lastname-feature'
        - e.g. 'colina-graph'
    3. Code feature
    4. Push features into your own branch
        - please refrain from pushing features with bugs/errors
    5. Create pull request
    6. Make sure to pull and merge into your local repo every now and then
        - usually after a pull request is accepted and merged

# File naming convention
    1. Components and features go into 'src/components/
    2. All images, colors, text, or any other resources belong to 'src/assets'
    3. File naming:
        - components/pages file names: fileName.JSX (notice camelCase)
        - component/function name: CompenentName (Capital CamelCase)
        - stylesheets: fileNameStyle.css 
        - classnames, ids, etc: any, but kebab case is encouraged (eg. my-classname)
    4. Sort components into folders by page
    5. All stylesheets belong to 'src/styles'
    6. Please do not edit App.js and App.css
